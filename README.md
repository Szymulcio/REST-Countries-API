## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup (with data attributes)
-   CSS custom properties (for theme switching)
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to complete all tasks this challenge included. 
It was my first project where I was using 3rd party API - I trained using fetch function and asynchronous functions.
Using flexbox and grid to position elements was very easy for me. Thanks to correct element posiioning, switching from mobile display to desktop was relatively easy.

Overall I'm very happy with how this project went and with knowledge and skill I gained.
